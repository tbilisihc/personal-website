  * The **footer** section at the bottom of the page is standardized and should not be modified. This ensures all member pages link back to important club resources.
    ```html
    <footer class="mt-8 text-center text-slate-500">
        <div
            class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-6"
        >
            <a
                class="hover:text-slate-900"
                href="[https://tbilisi.hackclub.com/privacy-policy](https://tbilisi.hackclub.com/privacy-policy)"
